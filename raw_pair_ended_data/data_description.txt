We downloaded high quality sequencing runs for publicly available metagenomes obtained from different parts of the human body from the NCBI SRA database. The data were selected according to rigorous filters in order to make comparison possible and limit irregularities between different sequenced runs from various studies. We selected runs obtained using Illumina sequencing instruments and whole genome sequencing. We selected for studies with a minimum threshold of 5Gb of total data and used experimental runs with over 100Mb. The SRA run selector interface was used to select for specific runs. Metagenomic data was screened by analyzing the papers that provided our data in order to identify steps to remove data contamination (from human or phiX genome). These rigorous steps allowed us to confirm the high quality and reliability of the selected data â€“ without introducing preferential bias.

The result figure is got from sample data from ENA: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA384716 (Run number: SRR5723843).
