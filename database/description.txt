Step 2.1 in meta.sh 2_raw_algs_db.dmnd: build database using eggNOG/bacteria/2_raw/ data from http://eggnog5.embl.de/#/app/downloads. (Not included in this folder due to its large size but the code to build it is included in the meta.sh).

Step 2.2 in meta.sh COGFC_GN.tsv.gz: is in the format of #column1:proteinID | #column2:OGname - encodes protein ID and its corresponding ortholog group(OG) in eggNOG database (Not included in this folder due to its large size but is easily got through simple data cleaning work). 

OGname is divided into two categories by EggNOG: COG - is more persistent in the evolution process that appear in abundant of descendents. nCOG (non COG) - is more species specific so that it is less persistent and fewer species own them.

Step 2.3 in meta.sh COG_sort_PI.tsv: is in the format of #column1:OGname | #column2: Persistent Index (PI), which is calculated by # species in this OG / # species in total dataset, for OG group.

Step 2.3 in meta.sh nCOG_PI.tsv: is in the format of #column1:OGname | #column2: Persistent Index (PI), which is calculated by # species in this OG / # species in total dataset, for non COG group.
